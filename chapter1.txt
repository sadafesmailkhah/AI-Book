Lena only spoke to two things: the moon and her black cat, hossi.

The moon listened politely. hossi listened better.

He followed her from room to room, a small shadow with bright brown eyes. When Lena read, he slept on the pages. When she cried, he pressed his warm body against her ribs like he was holding her together.

Then one afternoon, the front door didn’t latch.

By evening, hossi was gone.

Lena searched the neighborhood calling his name, her voice growing smaller each time. She shook his treat jar. She checked under porches and behind hedges. The moon rose, pale and unhelpful.

Days passed. Her house felt enormous without him. No soft paws. No low purr. Just the hollow echo of her own footsteps.

One night, Lena sat on the porch and whispered, “I miss you.”

A faint rustle came from the bushes.

Out stepped a thin black cat, fur dusty, eyes glowing gold in the dark.

“hossi?” she breathed.

The cat paused.

Then he walked toward her, slow and certain, as if he had never meant to leave at all.
