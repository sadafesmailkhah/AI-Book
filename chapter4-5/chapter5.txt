At the edge of the sea stood a lighthouse no one visited anymore.

Its paint had peeled. Its windows were cloudy with salt. Ships used brighter, newer lights now.

But every night, as the sky turned ink-blue, the lighthouse keeper still climbed the spiral stairs.

There were no ships on the horizon.

Still, he lit the lamp.

“Just in case,” he would say to the empty water.

One stormy evening, waves rose like dark mountains and rain swallowed the stars. The keeper nearly stayed below. No one would notice if the light remained dark.

But he climbed anyway.

He struck the match.

The lamp flared to life, a golden beam cutting through wind and water.

Far out at sea, a small fishing boat shifted course at the sight of it.

The keeper never saw the boat. He never heard the quiet thanks carried away by the storm.

But the light mattered.

And sometimes, that is enough.
