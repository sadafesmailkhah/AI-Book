In a small town where nothing ever changed, there was a clock tower that had stopped at 3:17.

No one remembered when it froze. People just learned to ignore it.

Except for Eli.

Every afternoon, he climbed the narrow stairs with a toolbox that was too heavy for him. He didn’t know much about clocks, but he knew what it felt like to be stuck.

At the top, dust floated in golden light. The gears were stiff, stubborn with rust.

“You just need a push,” he muttered.

Day after day, he cleaned, tightened, and tried again. The town laughed kindly. “It’s been broken forever,” they said.

One windy evening, as the sun dipped low, Eli turned the smallest gear one more time.

Click.

The hands trembled.

Tick.

Then, slowly, the clock began to move.

Down below, people stopped mid-step. Shop doors hung open. The sound echoed through the streets—steady and alive.

Eli smiled.

Sometimes things don’t need replacing.

Sometimes they just need someone who believes they can move again.
