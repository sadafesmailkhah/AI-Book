In the narrow alley behind the bakery lived a black cat named Onyx.

He liked the night. It matched him.

Every evening, he watched from the fence as a white cat stepped lightly across the rooftops. Her name, he learned from the old grocer, was Pearl. She liked the sun. It matched her.

They were opposites in everything—he moved like smoke, she like snowfall. He trusted no one. She trusted the world.

One dusk, Pearl slipped on a loose tile.

Before she could fall, Onyx leapt from the fence and steadied her with his shoulder. For a moment, black fur pressed against white, night against day.

“You watch too much,” Pearl said softly.

“Someone has to,” Onyx replied.

After that, they began meeting at twilight—the hour that belonged to neither sun nor moon. She told him about warm windowsills and kind hands. He told her about secret paths and quiet stars.

The alley no longer felt lonely. The rooftops no longer felt cold.

And when they sat together, their fur touching, they looked less like opposites—

and more like a single, perfect shade of gray.
