In a quiet garden behind a crumbling stone wall, a single rose bloomed later than the others.

Her petals were deep red, almost the color of a secret. While the other flowers opened proudly to the sun, she hesitated, keeping herself folded tight.

“I’m not ready,” she whispered to the wind.

The daisies laughed in bright white clusters. The tulips stood tall and certain. Even the shy violets peeked out from the grass.

But the rose waited.

One morning, a heavy rain fell. The garden bent under the weight of it. Petals scattered. Stems snapped. When the storm finally passed, the early bloomers looked tired and thin.

Slowly, carefully, the rose began to open.

Drop by drop, sunlight gathered in her velvet petals. She did not rush. She did not compete. She simply bloomed in her own time.

A child passing by the broken wall stopped and stared.

“Look,” she breathed. “The most beautiful one bloomed last.”

And the rose, warmed at last, understood—
waiting had not made her weaker.

It had made her ready.
