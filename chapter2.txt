Nora still walked the long way home.

It was the way they used to go—past the bakery that closed too early, across the park where the swings creaked like old doors, down the street where he once grabbed her hand and spun her in a circle just because it was raining.

He wasn’t there anymore.

No fight. No dramatic goodbye. Just a slow drifting—missed calls, shorter messages, promises that thinned out like fog in sunlight. Until one day, there was nothing left to hold.

But Nora held on anyway.

She kept their photos in the bottom drawer. She replayed his last voice note when the nights felt too wide. She slept on her side of the bed, leaving space out of habit.

What she missed most wasn’t the grand things. It was the small ones—the way he said her name like it meant something special. The quiet comfort of sitting beside someone who chose to stay.

One evening, she passed the park again. The swings were moving in the wind, empty.

She stood there for a long time, her chest tight with all the words she never got to say.

“I still love you,” she whispered, not expecting an answer.

The wind kept swinging the seats back and forth.

And for the first time, Nora realized she wasn’t waiting for him to come back.

She was just learning how to let him go.
