Clara counted the empty chairs in her house.

One at the kitchen table.
One by the window.
One across from her bed.

The one by the window used to belong to her older brother. He would sit there after school, tapping his fingers against the glass, telling her stories about the world beyond their street. He made everything sound bigger than it was.

Now the chair stayed perfectly still.

He had moved away months ago—new city, new job, new life. Everyone said it was a good thing. Clara nodded when they said that.

But at night, when the house settled into silence, she missed the sound of his voice drifting down the hallway. She missed the way he knocked twice on her door before coming in. She missed having someone who understood her quiet without trying to fix it.

One evening, she sat by the window in his old chair. The glass was cool against her forehead. The sky outside was the same color it had always been.

Her phone buzzed.

A message.

Guess what? You’d love this place. I found a bookstore that smells like old paper and rain.

A picture followed—crooked shelves, warm light, a grin she knew by heart.

Clara smiled, small but real.

The chair was still empty.

But somehow, it didn’t feel quite as lonely.
